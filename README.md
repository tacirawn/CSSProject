File Organization
index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the box elements.
styleA.css: styleA implements a vertical layout with altering colors where the spacing between the six boxes adjusts dynamically to the window height without changing the box sizes.
styleB.css: styleB defines a horizontal layout where elements remain on a single line without wrapping, and positions the final box to the bottom-right corner regardless of the viewport size.

Challenges
One of the main challenges I faced was effectively using absolute positioning to place the last box in the bottom-right corner relative to its container. Additionally, aligning the other boxes horizontally to ensure  
they stayed on the same line without wrapping, while maintaining the correct structure during window resizing, required careful adjustment of the CSS properties.
